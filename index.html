                <p>The Snap, as it is known, was one of the most devastating moments in recent cinematic memory. Watching Thanos fulfill
                his goal and seeing some of our favorite heroes fade into nothing was heartbreaking.</p>

            <section class="panel story-slide">
                <p>In the comics, The Snap occurs pretty early in the story, not even giving our heroes the opportunity to try to
                    prevent
                    it in the first place. Once the dust clears, the remaining roster of heroes differs quite a bit from the film
                    version.</p>
                <p>
                    Like the movies, Iron Man, Thor, and Captain America survive to take on Thanos. But some of the notable
                    survivors who
                    weren’t as lucky in the film include Doctor Strange, Scarlet Witch, and Spider-Man.

                <p>However, in the comics, Thanos is not the self-imposed martyr he is in the movies, and not willing to destroy the
                Stones.</p>
